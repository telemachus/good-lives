\section*{Introduction (Section I)}

Richard Kraut argues that we disagree with Aristotle over how to determine which people lead happy lives.
However, Kraut also argues that the usual way to distinguish Aristotle from us is wrong.
Most people, according to Kraut, say that happiness ``is, or at least involves, a certain state of mind'' but that \textit{eudaimonia} ``does not name a feeling or emotion.''%
\footcite[][167]{two-conceptions-of-happiness-kraut-1979}
According to Kraut, however, both happiness and \textit{eudaimonia} require ``certain attitudes towards one's life'' and that we ``measure up to certain standards.''%
\footcite[][197]{two-conceptions-of-happiness-kraut-1979}
That is, Aristotle agrees with us that \textit{eudaimonia} requires certain mental states.

In that case, where does Kraut think that we differ from Aristotle? Kraut explains as follows.

\begin{quote}
    Where we and Aristotle sharply disagree is over the standards to be used in evaluating lives.
    Roughly, he insists on an objective and stringent standard, whereas our test is more subjective and flexible.%
    \footcite[][197]{two-conceptions-of-happiness-kraut-1979}
\end{quote}

In addition, Kraut argues, contrary to a dominant scholarly view, that Aristotle does use \textit{eudaimonia} in ways parallel to our happiness.
Therefore, Kraut objects to translations of \textit{eudaimonia} as ``well-being'' or ``flourishing.''

% [[- Happy State of Mind (Section II)
\section*{Happy State of Mind (Section II)}

In this section, Kraut argues that Aristotle's \textit{eudaimon} is in the same positive state of mind as a contemporary happy person.
Kraut offers three arguments for this conclusion; the first relies on inference from what Aristotle says about the \textit{eudaimon}, and the other two rely on Aristotle's explicit arguments.

Here is Kraut's first argument.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item ``When we say that someone is living happily, we imply that he has certain attitudes towards his life: he is very glad to be alive; he judges that on balance his deepest desires are being satisfied and that the circumstances of his life are turning out well.''%
    \footcite[][170]{two-conceptions-of-happiness-kraut-1979}
    \item ``[The \textit{eudaimon}] loves the activities he regularly and successfully engages in.
        He thinks that exercising one's intellectual and moral capacities is the greates good available to human beings, and he knows that he possesses this good.
        Furthermore, he has all the other major goods he wants.
        His desire for such external goals as honor, wealth, and physical pleasure is moderate, and should be easy enough to satisfy in a normal life.''%
        \footcite[][170--171]{two-conceptions-of-happiness-kraut-1979}
    \item ``So, the individual who is most \textit{eudaimon} on Aristotle's theory passes our tests for happiness with flying colors.''%
        \footcite[][171]{two-conceptions-of-happiness-kraut-1979}
\end{enumerate}

Next, Kraut reminds us of something Aristotle that says explicitly.
According to Aristotle, good and fortunate people desire life most of all (\textit{NE} 1170a26--29).
Kraut says that Aristotle ``cannot mean that [\textit{the eudaimon}] will struggle to stay alive at any cost.
Rather, he must mean that such individuals are more glad to be alive than others; the kind of existence they enjoy gives them a heightened love of life.''%
\footcite[][1970]{two-conceptions-of-happiness-kraut-1979}

As part of this second argument, Kraut also points to passages where Aristotle says that people who possess \textit{eudaimonia} ``have the most reason to live'' and that ``they are the very opposite of the sort of individual who is so miserable and filled with self-hatred that he contemplates suicide.''
\footcite[][172]{two-conceptions-of-happiness-kraut-1979}
(Kraut refers to \textit{NE} 1117b9--13 and 1166b11--28 as support for his argument.)

For his final argument, Kraut turns to distinctions that Aristotle makes between humans, other animals, and plants.
(To support this argument, Kraut refers to \textit{DA} 413b1--2 and \textit{NE} 1070a16--17, where Aristotle explains that animals differ from plants because they perceive.
He also refers to \textit{EE} 1216a2--6, \textit{NE} 1095b32--35, and \textit{NE} 1176a34--35, where Aristotle says that no one would choose a lifetime of sleep since that is the life of a plant.)

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Unlike plants, says Aristotle, humans and other animals form desires for what we take to be good for us.
    \item Unlike other animals, humans form second-order desires for our first-order desires to be met.
        Non-human animals want all sorts of things, but they do not want their desires to be fulfilled.
        Thus, ``no person would choose a life in which he remains continually unaware of whether or not he possesses the good; that would be a life befitting plants, not human beings.''%
        \footcite[][172]{two-conceptions-of-happiness-kraut-1979}
    \item If a desire develops naturally and universally, we must satisfy it in order to qualify as \textit{eudaimon}.
    \item Therefore, in order to qualify as \textit{eudaimon}, we must satisfy our second-order desire to perceive that our first-order desires are met.
\end{enumerate}

Kraut supports this argument with a thought experiment.
He imagines a person who hears (falsely) that his family has been killed.
Even though this person still has every first-order good for an \textit{eudaimon} life, Kraut says that he is not \textit{eudaimon} because he lacks the self-perception that he has a good life.
In other words, the person grieves, and that grief impedes his happiness.

As a bonus, Kraut points out that his arguments work no matter what we think about the role of moral goodness in Aristotle's ideal life.
That is, Kraut makes ``no appeal\dots to Aristotle's theory that the best life is devoted to virtuous activity.''%
\footcite[][174]{two-conceptions-of-happiness-kraut-1979}
Instead, Kraut uses an argument that ``depends solely on some highly general features of human nature, and the point that a \textit{eudaimon} is without major defects.''%
\footcite[][174]{two-conceptions-of-happiness-kraut-1979}

Kraut ends this second with two clarifications.
First, he explains that he is not claiming that the word \textit{eudaimon} was only used in ordinary speech for people who felt happy or satisfied with their lives.
(Kraut seems to believe that this claim about language is true, but he doesn't require it for his argument to go through.)
Second, Kraut insists that satisfaction with one's life is a necessary but not a sufficient condition of \textit{eudaimonia} for Aristotle.
Aristotle can easily imagine cases where people are satisfied with their lives but they should not be.
Such cases, however, do not count against Kraut's larger argument unless we believe that the contemporary concept of happiness is entirely subjective.
Thus, Kraut makes a smooth transition to the next stage in his argument, where he will argue that the contemporary concept of happiness is not entirely subjective.
